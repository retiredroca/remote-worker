"""Local release driver.

Builds the release jars, commits the version bump, creates the GitHub tag + release, and then asks
CI to publish that release to CurseForge/Modrinth.

Typical use:

    python tools/release.py --mod all                 # build here, CI publishes it
    python tools/release.py --mod all --dry-run
    python tools/release.py --mod all --curseforge --modrinth

By default the GitHub release happens and then the publish-only workflow
(.github/workflows/publish-release.yml) is dispatched to upload the jars to CurseForge/Modrinth;
--no-ci-publish skips that. Passing --curseforge / --modrinth uploads from this machine instead,
reading CURSEFORGE_API_KEY / MODRINTH_TOKEN from the environment, and marks the release so a CI run
would skip it. The tag is a single series `v<api 3 parts>.<stamp>` (e.g. `v1.0.2.26091512`).

Component ids come from the project's own modules (versions/<mc>/*/module.properties), so the
`--mod` choices and the bundle names are never hardcoded here.
